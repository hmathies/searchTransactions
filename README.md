## Reflection
For this submission, I was able to get some, but not all of the features to work in the allotted time frame.  I started a few things, one of them being the modal confirmation of the submitted transfer.

This is not in my submission as it isn't working as expected. I also began but did not finish the amount field validation.  I would have liked to have formatted the input when the user types, but again, I was unable to complete this.  More to that, I have formatted the outgoing data from the "Make Transfer" component so that it aligns with the api data.

For the categoryCode, I am generating a random string.  For the merchantLogo, I am using a free service which returns a random image of 40 pixels.
